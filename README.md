This assignment tasked me with scraping mars data from the internet using the web scraping tools that I have learned. Then, I had to create a flask app that queries my MongoDB for the requisite information and creates a webpage using my index.html

I could not figure out how to get the table inputed directly from flask, so I copy and pasted the html code from the output file from my pd.to_html() function.
